TextCala is our text-based version of Mancala: textcala.cpp is what is used to run the code and the Makefile is used to compile it.

SharpCala is our Unity-based version with two scripts:
Script.cs is the state machine, user input, and graphic user interface.
AI.cs is the ai that reads the board and returns the best move it finds.
Mancala 2D.zip is the Unity file for SharpCala.

Together with some details in the unity engine, it makes a running Mancala Simulator.


Vestigial Code:
Within the Vestigial folder we have old and incomplete code which is kept to show our progress and future goals

ClickTracker.cpp and ClickTracker.h were to get user input in the graphics.h/Eclipse version of our code but was abandonned when we stopped using Eclipse.
state.cpp is the base for the state controller code which was changed slightly than implemented into TextCala and SharpCala.
aiprog.cpp is the base for the AI code which was implemented into TextCala and SharpCala.
finalproj is a folder containing the work for an SDL graphics version which was not completed at the time of our presentation.
