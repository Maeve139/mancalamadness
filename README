TextCala is our text-based version of Mancala: textcala.cpp is what is used to run the code and the Makefile is used to compile it.

SharpCala is our Unity-based version with two scripts:
Script.cs is the state machine, user input, and graphic user interface
Ai.cs is the ai that reads the board and returns the best move it finds.

Together with some details in the unity engine, it makes a running Mancala Simulator.




Vestigial Code:

ClickTracker.cpp and ClickTracker.h were to get user input in the graphics.h/Eclipse version of our code but was abandonned when we stopped using Eclipse.
